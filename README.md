# repository.alpha.yt

A small repo to host the most recent version of the youtube add-on used in other repos. This just makes it easier for me to update youtube in all my repos at once.

Developer of Add-on: https://github.com/anxdpanic/plugin.video.youtube

Needs Google API keys to work. For instructions see: https://youtu.be/dJ1oX9-zyhM
